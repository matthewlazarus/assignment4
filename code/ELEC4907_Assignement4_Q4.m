%% Part 4
% In order to deal with the non-linear element in the circuit, a new column
% matrix is introduced into the equation. Then, in order to solve the
% system, the jacobian of the matrix would need to be calculated. Then, the 
% Newton Raphson method is applied until the change in resulting values is 
% sufficiently small. Then, the time can be advanced and the
% jacobian+newton raphson method can be applied again.
